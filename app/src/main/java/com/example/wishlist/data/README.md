The app I have created is a wihslist app. Users can add items they want to the wishlist and delete them as they get each item.

This is the logo I created for the app which the original design was done using canva

# App Design:
When the app is launched it will bring you to the homepage where users can add an item to their wishlist or view all items in the list.

That is what I intended my home screen page to look like

There is a link to view the figma page.
